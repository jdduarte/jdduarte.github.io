### Git training
**tl:dr: [Here's the presentation](http://jdduarte.com/git-training/ "git training")**

I recently started working for [elgin](http://elgin.org.uk/ "elgin").

elgin is the largest source of roadworks information in the United Kingdom. We host roadworks and a range of other transport related datasets and services on a single map based portal at roadworks.org.

At my [previous gig](http://mapas.sapo.pt, "SAPO Mapas") I started using and fell in love with git. So the SVN repos here at elgin were an obstacle. I started using them with git2svn but that's just crippled git...

Furtunately I work with really cool guys who were already using git in another project and were looking forward to migrate the current SVN repos. Using only one source control system is the best way to go so I thought it was a good ideia to give a basic git training to all the team.

I think they liked it (specially the GoT references) and [it stays here for reference.](http://jdduarte.com/git-training/ "git training") Enjoy!
